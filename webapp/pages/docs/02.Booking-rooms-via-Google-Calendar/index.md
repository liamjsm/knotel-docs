If your booking conflicts with an existing booking, the room will decline your invitation. Otherwise it will accept it an a new booking will appear in your Knotel account.

You can update bookings details by changing events' properties: start date, length, attendees set, title, etc. Please note that deletion of an event won't effect in the corresponding booking cancellation.

If you have any questions, ping GM of your property for help.
