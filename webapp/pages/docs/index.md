This is a guide for manually subscribing to your Knotel conference room bookings using your personal iCalFeed url in Apple, Google and Outlook calendars. The steps for other calendar clients will be similar, as long as they support iCal Feeds. If you have any issues with the steps in this guide, or with calendars not listed in this guide please contact us.
Before using this guide, please attempt to set up your subscription automatically by clicking "Add To Calendar" in the "Calendar Settings" in your [Knotel Profile](https://knotel.com/profile). 

## Apple calendar

To subscribe for Knotel bookings in an Apple Calendar, open the Apple Calendar App, click on  'File' and then 'New Calendar Subscription'. You will then be asked to enter a calendar url. Copy and paste your personal iCal Feed URL from your "Calendar Settings" in your [Knotel Profile](https://knotel.com/profile), then click 'Subscribe'.

You will be prompted to give your bookings calendar a name and to set other settings like auto-refresh(sync) frequency. The auto-refresh frequency is th
e frequency at which your Apple Calendar will check whether you have made new bookings in your Knotel account and sync them to your bookings calendar. When you have set a name and sync frequency for your bookings calendar, click  'ok' to add the calendar.
