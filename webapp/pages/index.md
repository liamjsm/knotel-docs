### What is Knotel?
Knotel is headquarters as a service. It's scalable and adaptable for companies that want their brand and culture to shine, while saving money vs. leases. We serve bigger companies; it's flexible but it's not coworking.

## Stack

The Knotel App is a [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) / [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) server and web client.

The server serves the following
- [Knotel Mobile Clients](https://github.com/Knotable/knotel-mobile)
- [Knotel Discourse (community)](https://github.com/Knotable/knotel-discourse)
- Knotel Bot (tba)

All Knotel technology is served from our Amazon Web Services account, apart from email, which is sent via Postmark.
